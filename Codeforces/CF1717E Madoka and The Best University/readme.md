## description

Madoka wants to enter to "Novosibirsk State University", but in the entrance exam she came across a very difficult task:

Given an integer n, it is required to calculate ∑lcm(c,gcd(a,b)), for all triples of positive integers (a,b,c), where a+b+c=n.

In this problem gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor of x and y, and lcm(x,y) denotes the least common multiple of x and y.

Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to enter to the best university!

Input
The first and the only line contains a single integer n (3≤n≤105).

Output
Print exactly one interger — ∑lcm(c,gcd(a,b)). Since the answer can be very large, then output it modulo 109+7.
