# Nice-Questions-and-Solutions

When you come across good questions or beautiful solutions, you can upload them to this repository!

You can also view other people's uploaded questions, solutions and codes!

# Code
When you want to upload code, you should follow these rules.
- You should select the folder that corresponds to the OJ where the question originated. If there is no such folder, you can create a new one in the root directory, named after the OJ.
- Create a new folder under this folder and name it `Question ID` + `Question Title Name`. For example `CF1242D Number Discovery`, `P2067 Cytus-Holyknight`.
- Create a file named `readme.md` and add tags, including the difficulty of the Question, the type of Question, etc. You can also paste in the question description.
- Upload your solution in the folder, named after the author. If you have multiple solutions, you can add a numeric suffix to the file name, such as `unoexp 01.cpp`.


# Contest
